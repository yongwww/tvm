    """Reshape the input array.

    ``-1`` infers the dimension of the output shape by using the remainder of
    the input dimensions keeping the size of the new array same as that of the input array.
    At most one dimension of shape can be -1.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : relax.Expr
        The input data to the operator.

    shape : Union[Tuple[PrimExprLike], Expr]
        The new shape. Should be compatible with the original shape.

    Returns
    -------
    result : relax.Expr
        The reshaped result.

    Note
    ----
    The ``-1`` inference is only performed at compile-time.
    That is to say, in any case the dimension length of ``-1`` cannot be inferred in
    compile-time, an error will be thrown.
